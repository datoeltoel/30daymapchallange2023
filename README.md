One of the groups that utilize the sea is pirates. Piracy in the archipelago's sea waters dates back to the Srivijaya Empire. Based on records from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a body that collects and stores records of incidents self-reported by victims of sea piracy for decades around the world, including Indonesia.
