# 30 Day Maps Challange
Hello, Guys! This is a repository to store the mapping results that I worked on during November 2023, to participate in the #30daymapchallange.

### **DAY 01 - POINTS**

Tools: RStudio

Indonesia has been known as a maritime country with its oceans covering 70% of its entire territory. Therefore, many Indonesians depend on the sea for their livelihood. One of the groups that utilize the sea is pirates. Piracy in the archipelago's sea waters dates back to the Srivijaya Empire. Based on records from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a body that collects and stores records of incidents self-reported by victims of sea piracy for decades around the world, including Indonesia. For 34 years, from 1986 to 2020, Indonesian waters have experienced approximately 470 reported incidents of pirate assaults.

Australia is the smallest continent in the world with an area of only 7,682,300 km2. Although Australia is the smallest continent in the world, its landscape has a variety of beauty from mountains, beaches, lakes, forests, and rivers. The Darling River is the longest in Australia. The length of this river reaches 2,700 km, flowing in the state of New South Wales.

Tools: RStudio

Japan is one of the most developed countries in the world, which has advanced technological development and urban development. Some cities in Japan have become favorite tourist destinations and workplaces that are targeted to be visited, namely Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, and Sapporo. Each of these cities has its character, both in terms of urban planning and the lifestyle of the people who live there.

Tokyo, now the capital of Japan, has been a metropolitan prefecture since 1943, with 23 special wards or cities within it. More than 8 million people live in Tokyo, but the total number of people in the city every day can reach 30 million. Sapporo, famous for its annual snow festival, is the fifth most densely populated city in Japan at 1.9 million people.

What about other cities?

### **DAY 04 - BAD MAP**

Title: Land cover map in 1990 in the Upper Ciliwung watershed

Source data: https://lnkd.in/g_VMnUvz

Script: -

Tools: ArcGIS 10.5

This is one of the worst maps I ever made while studying at IPB University. Take a look, more than 20% of the land cover is clouds and cloud shadows. Even though the accuracy is very low, The overall accuracy is 50% with a kappa index of 0.37, which is included in the fair agreement category. 

The low accuracy of the land cover classification results, apart from the fact that the satellite imagery which is the main data, is quite poor, there are lots of clouds, it is also because the cloud masking process was not carried out and also there is a lot of haze.

This is a bad map enough, right?

### **DAY 05 - ANALOG MAP**

Title: Location Map of the Jonggol Livestock Education and Research Unit (UP3J)

Tools: Nikon 

IPB University has a garden area of 169 ha in the Jonggol area, approximately 60 km from Bogor to the east. In connection with the development program of IPB University, since 1980 the garden area in Jonggol was developed as a means of supporting education, research, community service, and extension in the field of animal husbandry. 

The Jonggol Animal Husbandry Education and Research Unit (UP3J) of the Faculty of Animal Husbandry of IPB University began to be built in 1985 - 1991, through cooperation with the Australian Government, and its management was carried out by IPB and Australia. 

In 1993, the management of UP3J was handed over to the Faculty of Animal Husbandry of IPB independently, through Rector Decree no. 020/Um/1993 dated March 15, 1993. (UP3J, which is also known as "Jonggol Animal Science Teaching and Research Unit (JASTRU)", is expected to be utilized and developed by the Faculty of Animal Husbandry both for the benefit of the Faculty of Animal Husbandry, other Faculties within IPB and the development of animal husbandry in Indonesia.

### **DAY 06 - ASIA**

Title: Topographic map of Philippines

Tools: RStudio

The Philippines is an archipelago located in Southeast Asia. Topographic conditions in the Philippines are quite diverse from low altitude to the highest point at Mount Apo at 3,776 meters above sea level. To describe the typical topographic conditions of the Philippines can use a topographic map. 

### **DAY 07 - NAVIGATION**
Title: Distance from Supermarket in Bogor

Source data: ©2018 Geofabrik GmbH and OpenStreetMap Contributors <https://lnkd.in/gWeZZ3ss>

Script: - 

Tools: ArcGIS & QGIS

What is the distance to the supermarket in Bogor, West Java, Indonesia? I used the multiple ring buffer tool in ArcGIS with a distance range of 5, 10, and 15 kilometers from the supermarket to find out the estimated access range to the supermarket.

Then, what about the travel time? I think it's difficult to estimate, because Bogor often experiences traffic jams, right?? 

### **DAY 08 - AFRICA**
Title: Habitat Distribution of Zebras in Africa
Source data: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2022-2. <https://lnkd.in/gB2V7San>

Tools: ArcGIS & Canva

Zebras are African equines with distinctive black-and-white striped coats. There are three living species: the mountain zebra (E. zebra), Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi), and the plains zebra (E. quagga).

Zebras' dazzling stripes make them among the most recognizable mammals. They have been featured in art and stories in Africa and beyond. Historically, they have been highly sought after by exotic animal collectors, but unlike horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated.


A distinctive feature of topographic maps is the use of elevation contour lines to show the shape of the earth's surface. An elevation contour is an imaginary line connecting points that have the same elevation on the ground above or below a reference surface, which is usually sea level. Contours make it possible to show the height and shape of mountains, the depth of the ocean floor, and the steepness of slopes.
