Indonesia has been known as a maritime country with its oceans covering 70% of its entire territory. Therefore, many Indonesians depend on the sea for their livelihood. One of the groups that utilize the sea is pirates. Piracy in the archipelago's sea waters dates back to the Srivijaya Empire. Based on records from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a body that collects and stores records of incidents self-reported by victims of sea piracy for decades around the world, including Indonesia. For 34 years, from 1986 to 2020, Indonesian waters have experienced approximately 470 reported incidents of pirate assaults.

Japan is one of the most developed countries in the world, which has advanced technological development and urban development. Some cities in Japan have become favorite tourist destinations and workplaces that are targeted to be visited, namely Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya, and Sapporo. Each of these cities has its character, both in terms of urban planning and the lifestyle of the people who live there.

Tokyo, now the capital of Japan, has been a metropolitan prefecture since 1943, with 23 special wards or cities within it. More than 8 million people live in Tokyo, but the total number of people in the city every day can reach 30 million. Sapporo, famous for its annual snow festival, is the fifth most densely populated city in Japan at 1.9 million people.

What about other cities?
